# Getting Started

First off, I'm going to assume you installed one of the two modpack files included in the discord, judging by how you clicked on this link. If you haven't go back to #mc-annoucements and click on the pinned messages button to get them and read my directions there.


## Open Parties and Claims

Going right into the reason for why I even really needed to write any of this, we have OpenPAC and its unnecessarily confusing commands. 


![2023-09-08_13 31 55](https://github.com/ash3yb1tch/SASGCreadme/assets/125123809/79d4b87d-be57-4c18-a3c4-2abc963cde71)


The most important thing you should know is the keybind to open the menu for the mod, which is the `'` key by default. If all you needed was to know how to claim chunks for yourself, then this menu will be plenty for that purpose, including some settings you can tweak as you please. 

Now comes the hard part, which is setting up and joining Parties. The following commands should serve to fulfil most purposes you wish to achieve with the mod, but if you need further help feel free to ask me on Discord by pinging "@ash3yb1tch" 

#### Creating a Party
```
/openpac-parties create
```
#### Deleting a Party
```
/openpac-parties destroy confirm
```
#### Inviting someone to a Party
```
/openpac-parties member invite [@username]
```
#### Leaving a Party
```
/openpac-parties leave
```

## Simple Voice Chat

The next mod on our list, Simple Voice Chat is true to its namesake. To open the menu for the mod simply press the `V` key on your keyboard, where you will then see a few options. 

![2023-09-08_13 37 44](https://github.com/ash3yb1tch/SASGCreadme/assets/125123809/5d765d50-1209-4f08-8556-20506f7a8b65)

The most important thing you will want to do first is to click on settings and choose a microphone to use, which is located in the bottom left of the new menu. After this, you may feel free to look through the other settings in here, such as the option to switch between Push-to-Talk and Voice, or amplifying the volume of your microphone. 

![2023-09-08_13 42 53](https://github.com/ash3yb1tch/SASGCreadme/assets/125123809/0b171e70-78f2-4822-8f98-6658c91bb1a9)

If you exit this menu and reenter the main menu, you can now select the button on the right side which says "Group" or you can press `G` to see this same screen. You will now see a screen that informs you of the currently active groups, as well as a button at the bottom to create your own.

![2023-09-08_13 42 57](https://github.com/ash3yb1tch/SASGCreadme/assets/125123809/1b82ccb9-2a25-42bd-b90b-7b010c3992c9)

## Traveler's Backpack

Traveler's Backpack is a rather simple mod, which adds various different backpacks to the game which, along with providing extra inventory space, also provide some additional benefits. To get started with the mod, you are going to want to craft the most basic backpack, aptly named "Standard Traveler's Backpack" which has the following crafting recipe.

![2023-09-08_13 50 10](https://github.com/ash3yb1tch/SASGCreadme/assets/125123809/d85920a6-c39b-4796-bbd2-2e9d2a4fb5aa)

The only thing one really needs to know is that to wear a backpack one presses right-click when looking at the air while holding a backpack in your hand, and that you can press `B` to access the backpack inventory while wearing it. From this point on the freedom is yours to explore the different backpacks included in the mod and the benefits it provides. If you wish to read more about the features found in the mod, access this link: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/travelers-backpack where you can scroll down and read about the full list of features.
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>


## RightClickHarvest

While the mod does not need much instruction, it is still important one learns to use this mod instead of manually breaking crops. Simply right-click on a fully grown crop and the mod will automatically utilise the seed gained from breaking a crop to replant it and give you the leftover items. 

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>


## Farmer's Delight

Farmer's Delight is a mod which adds various different food products and crops to the game for you to enjoy. To learn more simply access this link: https://farmersdelight.fandom.com/wiki/Farmer%27s_Delight_Wiki where you can explore the many features in the mod.
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>


## GrowthcraftCE

Similar to the previous mod, GrowtcraftCE adds a wide variety of food items to the game, with a focus on drinks and cheese. While slightly outdated, the most detailed information for the mod can be found at this link: https://github.com/GrowthcraftCE/Growthcraft-1.12/wiki#wiki which contains explanations of all the features in the different parts of the mod. If you need further help, feel free to join the GrowtcraftCE discord server using this link: https://discord.gg/Quh76Jn
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>


## Enchantment Descriptions

Another mod that does not require much explanation, Enchantment Descriptions is an incredibly helpful mod that adds short descriptions to all the enchantment books in the game, helpfu for players new and old alike.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>


## MrCrayfish's Furniture Mod

While the mod does not require much instruction, it is helpful for one to know the various crafting recipes in the mod, which can be found at this link: https://mrcrayfishs-furniture-mod.fandom.com/wiki/Crafting_Recipes_List

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>


## Paintings ++

For this mod you do not need to anything new to capitalise on the new features added by the mod, which is a variety of new paintings as well as custom paintings added by the mod team.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>


# Extra Version Additions


<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## JEI and JER

JEI and JER are two incredibly helpful mods bundled in the Extra version of the modpack, which provide the amazing utility of showcasing all the items in the modpack as well as their crafting recipes. JER is an addon for JEI which showcases the ways to find certain non-craftable items, as well as the world generation statistics for ores, such as what y-level diamonds most often spawn at.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>


## Xaero's Minimap and Worldmap

Both mods working together to help you navigate in the world of Minecraft, the Xaero's map mods provide both a customisable minimap on your screen and a full worldmap you can access by pressing `M` on your keyboard. The world map also has a feature many of you will appreciate, which is integration with OpenPAC to showcase what chunks have been claimed, allowing for easier ability to find your own area to settle. There are additonal settings found on the worldmap screen, both located in the top left corner settings button, as well as some located on the sides of the screen. 

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>


## Mouse Tweaks

Mouse tweaks is a simplistic but useful mod which modifies some of the existing inventory keybinds to allow for easier item management. By accessing this link: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mouse-tweaks you can read about the changes and see visual examples.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>


# Extras

  Section containing any additional mods you may want to manually add, I might update this at some point if stuff is brought to my attention.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>


## Optifine

Based on some testing, the current stable release of Optifine for 1.20.1 does not work with the modpack, causing a crash. If you have experience with any of this feel free to try it on your own machine and see if it works for you. If you would just like to use the working version, this link: https://optifine.net/adloadx?f=preview_OptiFine_1.20.1_HD_U_I6_pre6.jar to the prerelease file functions. Simply download the file from the website, and then going back to the CurseForge app, click on the profile icon for whichever modpack version you are using. You then want to click on the three dots next to the play button, which will open up an extra set of buttons, where you will want to click on "Open Folder" and wait it for to open. When it loads, look through the list of folders and files for a folder named "mods" and insert the downloaded Optifine .jar file directly into this folder. You should now be able to return to CurseForge and launch your game, enjoying the benefits of Optifine like better performance and the ability to zoom in with the `C` key.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Shaders

If you would like to utilise the full features of Optifine, I can recommend using the shaders found at this link: https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/shaders/sildurs-vibrant-shaders/files where you can select one of the availabe presets based on how capable your machine is. Once you have selected one of the presets, you will want to navigate to your shaders folder. The way I find easiest is to access it through Minecraft, by pressing the escape key on your keyboard while ing-game then clicking "Options" followed by "Video Settings" and lastly "Shaders" where you will now see a button in the bottom left to open your shaders folder. Clicking on this button, you now want to insert the .zip file you installed either from the link provided, or a shader of your choice. Returning to your game, now click on the name of the shader in the menu and wait for your game to reload, finding that your shader is now active.
